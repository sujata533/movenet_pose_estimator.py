# movenet_pose_estimator

This repository contains an easy-to-use Python API that helps you run inferences and perform on-device transfer learning with TensorFlow Lite models on Coral devices.

To install the prebuilt PyCoral library, see the instructions at coral.ai/software/.

Note: If you're on a Debian system, be sure to install this library from apt-get and not from pip. Using pip install is not guaranteed compatible with the other Coral libraries that you must install from apt-get. For details, see coral.ai/software/.
